# Monterey Jack
[Monterey Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_%27n_Dale:_Rescue_Rangers#Main_characters) is a friend to zippers. Given a directory, it will recursively create .gz files for use with Nginx's [`gzip_static` directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html#gzip_static). Extensions it handles are .html, .htm, .css, .js, .svg, and .xml.
